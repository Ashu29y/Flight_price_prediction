# Flight_price_prediction  

**Overview**
This project focuses on predicting flight prices using machine learning algorithms. It incorporates various features, including data preprocessing , feature engineering ,etc. to enhance the predictive model's accuracy.

**Features**
**Flight Price Prediction:** Utilizes machine learning models to predict flight prices based on several input features.
**Encoding Techniques:** Implements one-hot encoding, label encoding, and target encoding for handling categorical variables in the dataset.
Encoding Techniques  

**One-Hot Encoding**
One-hot encoding is used to convert categorical variables into binary vectors. It is applied to categorical features such as airline names, departure cities, or flight classes. This technique ensures that machine learning algorithms can interpret categorical data appropriately.

**Label Encoding**
Label encoding is utilized to convert categorical labels into numerical form. It assigns a unique integer to each category, making it suitable for ordinal categorical data. For instance, it may be applied to encode flight class categories like 'Economy,' 'Business,' and 'First Class.'

**Usage**
**Data Preprocessing:** Apply one-hot encoding, label encoding, and target encoding to categorical variables in the dataset.
**Feature Engineering:** Combine encoded categorical features with numerical features for model training.
**Model Training:** Train machine learning models using the combined encoded features and other relevant features.
**Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using appropriate regression evaluation metrics.

**Contributions**
